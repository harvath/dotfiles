# dotfiles
Some of my config files. Not a big fan of over-customization so I try to make them concise.

## usage
# make sure GNU Stow is installed (brew install stow)
git clone, git submodules init 
then run the setup script

## external applications 
Some configs rely on external apps.

#### Vim
* ripgrep
* fzf

#### Others
* exa
